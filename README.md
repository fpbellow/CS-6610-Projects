A series of graphics programming assignments completed as part of the [CS-6610 Course](https://graphics.cs.utah.edu/courses/cs6610/spring2021/) taught by Cem Yuksel at the University of Utah.  
These projects were implemented using DirectX 11 to deepen understanding of real-time rendering and graphics systems.
